-- Tests requiring manual grading for ACATS 4.1 (with modification list 4.1H)
-- and GNAT Pro 18.1 when GNAT is run using the GNATScrp and GNATEvnt tools on
-- Windows.

-- The following tests have foreign language source files (these require
-- manual construction of test run scripts, which we are not doing):
CD30005
CXB3004
CXB3006
CXB3013
CXB3017
CXB3018
CXB3023
CXB3024
CXB4009
CXB5004
CXB5005

-- The following tests contain multiple partitions and thus need special
-- binding and execution instructions:
CXE1001
CXE2001
CXE2002
CXE4001
CXE4002
CXE4003
CXE4004
CXE4005
CXE4006
CXE5002
CXE5003
LXE3001
LXE3002

-- The following tests need a custom (but legal) compilation script:
B91001D -- A task unit (not allowed) GNATChops as a specification,
        -- but the test summary tool gives these nonexistent units a body
        -- kind. Thus the wrong chopped source file is compiled.
B91001E -- Same as B91001D.
BA1001A -- Some of these contain illegal unit names; GNATScrp tries to use these names to compile,
        -- but GNATChop used something else.
BA1020A -- When BA1020A1 is GNATChopped, an old body file needs to be deleted.
BA1020B -- When BA1020B1 is GNATChopped, an old spec file needs to be deleted.
BA1020C -- When BA1020C1 is GNATChopped, an old spec file needs to be deleted.
C250002 -- The grading summary tool does not currently work with UTF-8 file names, so the script malfunctions.
BA14002 -- When BA140026 is GNATChopped, an old spec file needs to be deleted.
C3A1003 -- The first two source files needs to be GNATChopped before any compilations (see "special requirements").
C3A1004 -- The first two source files needs to be GNATChopped before any compilations (see "special requirements").
CA1020E -- When CA1020E2 is GNATChopped, an old body file needs to be deleted.
CA11023 -- The second source file needs to be GNATChopped first (see "special requirements").
CA12001 -- The second source file needs to be GNATChopped first (see "special requirements").
CA14028 -- When CA140283 is GNATChopped, four old spec files need to be deleted.
CC51010 -- The third source file needs to be GNATChopped first (see "special requirements").
LC30003 -- Both of the first two source files have to be GNATChopped before any compilations are attempted.

-- The following tests intentionally have "aberrant termination", and thus are reported
-- as failed, but actually are supposed to require special handling:
EB4011A
EB4012A
EB4014A


-- The following tests should be graded N/A, but the error message isn't in the standard format
-- with no location and only occurs as a bind error:
CXAG002
CXD2007
CXDB001
CXDB002
CXDB003
CXDB004

-- The following tests require splitting:
B25002B -- Illegal uses of formatting control characters; far more errors than are needed.
B26005A -- Illegal uses of formatting control characters; far more errors than are needed (and the line counts get messed up).
B33102A -- Extra errors from "missing bodies" for F & G (@47, @48) - the bodies exist. Split needed to prove that this is
        -- an error cascade issue.
B33102B -- Extra errors from "missing bodies" for F & G (@47, @48) - the bodies exist. Split needed to prove that this is
        -- an error cascade issue.
B33102C -- Extra errors from "missing bodies" for F & G (@50, @51) - the bodies exist. Split needed to prove that this is
        -- an error cascade issue. Also extra errors from uncompleted incomplete types (a test issue).
B33102D -- Extra errors from "missing bodies" for F & G (@49, @50) - the bodies exist. Split needed to prove that this is
        -- an error cascade issue.
B33102E -- Extra errors from "missing bodies" for F & G (@47, @48) - the bodies exist. Split needed to prove that this is
        -- an error cascade issue.
B660001 -- Errors @125 & @129 reported on the previous line, also extra error @133 because illegal "/=" conflicts with
        -- legal "=". The latter would require a test split to process formally (to prove that it goes away without @110).
B83004B -- Extra errors for "missing bodies" for T & Fun (@f1-42) - the bodies exist. Split needed to prove that this is
        -- an error cascade issue. Similar issues in files 2 and 3.
B83004C -- Extra errors for "missing bodies" for T & Fun (@f0-67) - the bodies exist. Split needed to prove that this is
        -- an error cascade issue. Similar issues in files 1 and 2.
B83004D -- Extra errors for "missing bodies" for T & Fun (@f1-43) - the bodies exist. Split needed to prove that this is
        -- an error cascade issue. Similar issues in files 2 and 3.
B83F02A -- Extra error for "missing bodies" for Proc3 (@54) - the body exists. Split needed to prove that this is
        -- an error cascade issue.

-- The following test fails to bind as it requires a special version of the runtime:
CXH1001 -- Runtime needs to be recompiled with Normalize_Scalars.

-- The following tests need manual grading because the error is reported after
-- the ERROR: tag:
B26001A -- Missing close quotes; the error tag is considered part of the string.
B26002A -- Missing close quotes; the error tag is considered part of the string.


-- The following tests need manual grading because of errors reported
-- on the wrong line:
B32201A -- Errors @90 & @104 reported on the previous line.

-- The following tests have restriction errors in "old" units; if the implementation
-- recompiles the unit after seeing the configuration pragmas, (expected) but unmarked
-- compilation errors will occur. Probably these should be marked as optional errors.
-- Note: It's unclear that changing these tests would allow the grading tool to
-- handle these, as they're appearing in the "wrong" compilation unit.
LXH4002 -- Optional errors in first unit. -- Works as expected in GNAT.
LXH4004 -- Optional errors in first unit.

-- The following tests require manual grading because they have (duplicate)
-- extra errors in places that the tests don't allow them:
B371001 -- Compiling the main (in file 4) regenerates all of the errors from file 2.
B3A1001 -- Bizarre error handling (some messages on previous line, but also extra errors on previous units).

BA2011A -- Extra errors @f6-41 & @f6-47 related to test errors.
BA3006B -- Compiling the main (in file 4) regenerates error from file 1 (which really is one of the errors from file 3).

BC3604B -- Extra errors @90 & @93 related to the test errors.

-- The following Annex tests appear to fail on Windows (probably doesn't have the appropriate
-- real-time behavior). Most likely, the implementation would not attempt to do a conformity
-- assessment against Annex D on this target, so these do not represent a real problem. Note
-- that these tests can't be "manually graded", as they outright report failure.
